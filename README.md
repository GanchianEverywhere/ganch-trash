Hello!

This is a simple qb-core trash can script, it allows players to open a stash that doesn't save to the database so they can dispose of items without littering.

Requirements:

qb-core
qb-target
an older version of qb-inventory (before may 20th, 2024)

How to use this:
Open config.lua
Add all the props you want to in Config.TrashModels
Add ensure ganch-trash in your server.cfg(after qb-inventory and qb-target)
Restart your server (or f8 refresh then f8 ensure ganch-trash)
Use your qb-target button (L Alt by default) to open a stash
Throw away any items you want
Close the stash
Re-open the stash twice to make sure the items are gone forever
